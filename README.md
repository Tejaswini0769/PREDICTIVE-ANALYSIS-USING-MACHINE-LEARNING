DESCRIPTION:
The **"pregnancy\_risk\_analysis.ipynb"** notebook is a data analysis and machine learning project focused on assessing pregnancy-related risks using data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). The analysis begins with importing essential Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data processing, visualization, and modeling. The dataset is loaded and cleaned by standardizing column names and inspecting its structure. Subsequent sections involve data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and possibly feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling. Machine learning models, including Linear Regression and Random Forest, are applied to predict or classify risk factors associated with pregnancy outcomes. Overall, the notebook aims to derive meaningful insights and predictive patterns to support maternal health research and decision-making.
